## Description

### About the App

OrganicFoods provides a comprehensive online shopping experience with these core features:

- **Product Browsing**: Filter products by category (vegetables, fruits, dairy, grains) and dietary preferences (organic, vegan, gluten-free, locally sourced)
- **Detailed Product Information**: View nutritional facts, sourcing details, and environmental impact
- **Shopping Cart**: Add products, adjust quantities, and manage your cart with persistent storage

I created this application to bridge the gap between local organic farmers and consumers who value healthy, sustainable food. The platform promotes:

- Sustainable agriculture practices
- Reduced food miles through local sourcing
- Transparency about food origins and production methods
- Education about organic foods through recipes and product information
